# Command Suite — Shared-Data Contract  [DESIGN-SEED · DESIGN-OPEN]

**Status:** Design-open. This captures the question, the evidence, and the decision dimensions — **no answers**. For a dedicated design session, not a build.

**Origin:** Spun out of the staged-ready-cards build smoke test, 2026-05-28 (sch-command, `feat/staged-ready-cards`). That build worked on its own surface, but smoke testing kept surfacing cross-app data questions that no document answers. They're not separate bugs — they're symptoms of an unwritten shared-data contract.

**Home note:** Lives in sch-command for now because that's where the evidence originated. May belong in a canonical cross-suite location later (cf. the cross-repo precedent `~/sales-command/docs/plans/o7_migration_coordination.md`).

## The core question (Chris's framing)

The 4 Command Suite apps — **Sales, Schedule, Field, AR** — run on **one shared Supabase DB** (`pbgvgjjuhnpsumnowuym`):

1. **Where do the 4 commands connect** — which entities cross app boundaries?
2. **What needs to be shared** — the actual shared-data set, no more, no less.
3. **How should the source of that sharing be shaped** — canonical storage, ownership, direction, mechanism.

## The two dimensions that make "shaped" concrete

Every shared entity must answer these, or it drifts:

- **Source of truth** — which app *writes* it (ideally exactly one); which apps *read* it, and read-only vs read-write.
- **Copy vs reference + sync pipe** — is the data a snapshot copied at a handoff (drifts after) or a live reference? And which mechanism carries it: **PostgREST** (Sales/Schedule/AR web) vs **PowerSync local SQLite** (Field Command)? They read differently, so "shaped" must name the pipe.

## Evidence — what the smoke test found

Each row is a place where ownership / canonical location is ambiguous *today*:

| Data | Direction | Current reality (the ambiguity) |
|---|---|---|
| **SOW (`field_sow`)** | Sales → Sch → Field | No single home. Card reads `job_wtcs[].field_sow` (per-WTC, preferred); Field Command reads `jobs.field_sow` (single); Sales authors `proposal_wtc.field_sow`. Three locations. Multi-work-type jobs are where it breaks. |
| **PRT + Daily Logs** | Field → Sch | ✅ Coherent. Field writes `daily_production_reports` + `daily_log_entries`; Sch reads. The one direction that *is* contracted. |
| **Notes (`jobs.notes`)** | Sch → Field (view-only) | Not wired. Field Command's "notes" are its own report notes; it doesn't read `jobs.notes`. |
| **PROP (`jobs.amount`)** | Sales → Sch | Card reads `jobs.amount`; where Sales sets it (send-to-schedule? copy?) unconfirmed. |
| **BILLED** | Sales → Sch | Card computes from `billing_log` (a Schedule table); no Sales write to it found; invoices live in `invoices`/`invoice_lines`. Three candidate owners. |
| **Attachments** | Sch ↔ Field (view-only) | Not built (§7 deferred). Needs canonical store + cross-app read + PowerSync rules. |

## Open decisions to resolve in the design session

1. **Canonical `field_sow` location** — one home that Sales authors, Schedule edits, and Field reads; reconcile the `job_wtcs` (per-WTC) vs `jobs.field_sow` (single) split, with multi-work-type jobs as the test case.
2. **`jobs.notes` → Field Command** — should it sync, view-only? If yes, which pipe.
3. **BILLED source of truth** — `billing_log` vs `invoices`/`invoice_lines`; which app owns billing state, and how the card derives % from it.
4. **PROP/amount origin** — confirm where `jobs.amount` is set and whether it's a copy or reference.
5. **Attachments (§7)** — canonical store, cross-app view-only contract, PowerSync sync rules. Its own build loop after this contract lands.
6. **Copy-vs-reference policy for send-to-schedule** — `proposal_wtc → job_wtcs` is a snapshot today; decide whether post-handoff drift is acceptable per entity, or edits must propagate.

## Explicitly not in scope here

Answers. This seed frames the design session; it must not pre-decide it. The SOW-builder port (reuse Sales Command `WTCCalculator` in sch-command) is **blocked on decision #1** — build it once the canonical location is set, not before.
